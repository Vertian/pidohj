### Instructions | How to use
* **Raspberry Pi 3**

**`RECOMMENDED:` When you first boot your Raspberry Pi ensure that you `sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade -y ; sudo reboot` and `ssh` back into the Raspberry Pi before running the `install-vertnode.sh` script.**
```
git clone https://github.com/e-corp-sam-sepiol/vertnode.git
cd vertnode/
chmod +x install-vertnode.sh
sudo ./install-vertnode.sh 
```

------------

### Functioning Status
- [x] Raspberry Pi 3 B+ | ARM Cortex-A53 1.4GHz | 1GB SRAM | 

## Testing Errors

- [x] **Configuring firewall | Fixed with: `sudo reboot` then re-run `install_vertnode.sh`**

**`RECOMMENDED:` When you first boot your Raspberry Pi ensure that you `sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade -y ; sudo reboot` and `ssh` back into the Raspberry Pi before running the `install-vertnode.sh` script.**

**This error occurs when `sudo apt-get upgrade` installs a new kernel to the Raspberry Pi, it affects `iptables` which is a part of the kernel. Updating the kernel requires a reboot.**
```
ERROR: initcaps
[Errno 2] iptables v1.6.0: can't initialize iptables table `filter': Table does not exist (do you need to insmod?)
Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.
```

### Vertnode | Automated Vertcoin full node Installation Testing Results
- [x] Raspberry Pi 3 - **Installs Vertcoin full node** | **Installs p2pool-vtc node** | **Looks for USB flash drives (`sda`) for storage.** More testing to be done. Small amount of user input required. 
- [ ] Raspberry Pi Zero W - Not tested
- [ ] Intel NUC - Not tested

### Raspberry Pi
#### Download Raspbian Stretch Lite
`https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/`  

We will utilize the software 'Win32 Disk Imager' to format and install Raspbian on the MicroSD card. Please follow the [guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md) below for details on installing the Rasbian image to the MicroSD card.

![Writing...](https://i.imgur.com/DrGi0mb.png)  
![Done](https://i.imgur.com/cfUjvKR.png)

Once Win32 Disk Imager is finished writing to the MicroSD card please access the 'boot' partition of the MicroSD card with Windows Explorer `Win+E`. Create a new empty text file named `ssh` like so...

![MicroSD card - ssh](https://i.imgur.com/m14rGdV.png)  
This enables `SSH` access on the Raspberry Pi's first boot sequence. 

### How to enable wireless connection on boot if hard wiring is not available

Create another new text file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` that will hold the network info...

Edit the file that you just created adjusting for the name of your country code, network name and network password.

```
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="NETWORK-NAME"
    psk="NETWORK-PASSWORD"
}
```
Please safely remove the USB Card Reader / MicroSD card as to ensure the data is not corrupted.

Insert the MicroSD card that was safely removed into the microSD slot the Raspberry Pi. Once the Pi has booted it will attempt to join the wireless network using the information provided in the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file.
